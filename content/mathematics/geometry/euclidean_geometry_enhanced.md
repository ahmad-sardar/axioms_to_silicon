# Introduction

Euclidean geometry forms the spatial reasoning foundation essential for machine learning. From understanding projections in high-dimensional spaces to grasping optimization landscapes, these concepts are fundamental prerequisites.

{% callout_warning() %}
## Why This Matters for Machine Learning

- **Vector Spaces**: Geometric objects with distance and angles
- **Optimization**: Gradient descent as geometric motion
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Projections preserve geometric structure
- **Kernel Methods**: Distance-based similarity in feature space
- **Neural Networks**: Each layer performs geometric transformation

# Axioms and Postulates 

> *"The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God."* — Euclid

## Motivation & Context

### Historical Setting

In 3rd century BCE Alexandria, Euclid faced a challenge: how to organize all known geometry into a logical system? Rather than present thousands of disconnected facts, he identified a minimal set of **self-evident truths** from which everything else could be derived.

This revolutionary approach:
- Established the axiomatic method still used in mathematics
- Influenced formal logic and computer science
- Demonstrated that complex knowledge can be built from simple foundations

### The Problem

Without axioms, we face **infinite regress**:
- To prove theorem A, we need theorem B
- To prove theorem B, we need theorem C
- To prove theorem C, we need theorem D...
- *Where does it end?*

Euclid's solution: Start with statements so obvious they need no proof.

### Modern Relevance

**In ML/CS:**
- Programming languages have axioms (basic operations)
- Formal verification systems use axiomatic foundations
- Type theory builds on logical axioms
- Probabilistic reasoning starts with probability axioms

**Key Insight:** Complex systems require foundational assumptions. The art is choosing the **minimal sufficient set**.

## Intuitive Picture

Think of axioms as the "rules of the game" for geometry:

**Point** → GPS coordinate (location, no size)  
**Line** → Stretched string (shortest path)  
**Plane** → Infinite tabletop (flat surface)  
**Distance** → Measuring tape result

**Mental Model:** You have an infinite blank canvas and two tools:
1. **Unmarked straightedge** (draw lines)
2. **Compass** (draw circles)

The axioms tell you:
- What operations are allowed
- What properties are guaranteed
- What you can assume without proof

{% callout_tip() %}
## Visualization Exercise

Close your eyes. Imagine two dots floating in space. Now imagine the shortest path between them. That path is unique—this is Postulate 1's intuitive content.
{% end %}

## Precise Definitions

### Undefined Terms

Three concepts are **primitive** (undefined, but understood intuitively):

{% callout_note() %}
**Point:** An object with no dimensions (position only)  
**Line:** A one-dimensional object extending infinitely in both directions  
**Plane:** A two-dimensional flat surface extending infinitely
{% end %}

**Why undefined?** To avoid circular definitions. These are our starting vocabulary.

### Euclid's Five Postulates

{% callout_note() %}
**Postulate 1** (Uniqueness of Line).  
*Given any two distinct points $P$ and $Q$, there exists exactly one line $\ell$ passing through both.*

**Postulate 2** (Line Extension).  
*Any line segment can be extended indefinitely in both directions to form a line.*

**Postulate 3** (Circle Construction).  
*Given any point $C$ (center) and any positive distance $r$ (radius), there exists a circle with center $C$ and radius $r$.*

**Postulate 4** (Right Angle Congruence).  
*All right angles are congruent to one another.*

**Postulate 5** (Parallel Postulate).  
*Given a line $\ell$ and a point $P$ not on $\ell$, there exists exactly one line through $P$ parallel to $\ell$.*
{% end %}

### Common Notions (Axioms of Equality)

{% callout_note() %}
**CN1** (Transitivity). If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$.

**CN2** (Addition). If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$.

**CN3** (Subtraction). If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a - c = b - d$.

**CN4** (Coincidence). Things that coincide are equal.

**CN5** (Whole vs Part). The whole is greater than any proper part.
{% end %}

## Why These Definitions

### Why These Specific Five Postulates?

**Postulates 1-4:** Relatively "obvious"
- Can verify locally with physical tools
- Match immediate intuition
- Universally accepted

**Postulate 5:** Controversial!
- Cannot verify by direct observation (requires infinite extension)
- More complex statement
- Led to 2000 years of attempted proofs

### Why Is Postulate 5 Special?

It's the only postulate that:
1. **Requires infinity**: Must extend lines infinitely to verify
2. **Determines curvature**: Characterizes flat (Euclidean) space
3. **Is independent**: Cannot be derived from Postulates 1-4

**Historical Impact:** Attempts to prove Postulate 5 from 1-4 ultimately led to:
- Hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky, Bolyai)
- Elliptic geometry (Riemann)
- General relativity (Einstein)

### Why Axioms of Equality?

These establish **logical consistency**:
- Enable substitution in proofs
- Allow algebraic manipulation
- Provide ordering relations

Without them, we couldn't reason about relationships between measurements.

## Key Properties

From these axioms, immediate consequences follow:

**Property 1** (Uniqueness). Given specific conditions, geometric objects are uniquely determined:
- Two points → one line
- Center + radius → one circle
- Line + external point → one parallel

**Property 2** (Existence). Geometric objects can always be constructed:
- Lines can be drawn and extended
- Circles always exist for any radius
- Intersections occur (when not parallel)

**Property 3** (Consistency). No contradictions arise:
- Equality is transitive and symmetric
- Measurements can be compared
- Whole > Part establishes order

## Main Theorems

These axioms enable us to prove *everything else*:

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 1.1** (Vertical Angles).  
*When two lines intersect, vertical angles are congruent.*

**Theorem 1.2** (Triangle Angle Sum).  
*The sum of interior angles in any triangle equals 180°.*

**Theorem 1.3** (SSS Congruence).  
*Triangles with three pairs of congruent sides are congruent.*

**Theorem 1.4** (Pythagorean Theorem).  
*In a right triangle: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.*

**Theorem 1.5** (Parallel Line Properties).  
*When a transversal crosses parallel lines, corresponding angles are congruent.*
{% end %}

*All of these follow logically from the five postulates!*

## Computational Methods

### How to Use Axioms in Proofs

**Standard Proof Structure:**

```
Given: [What we know]
Prove: [What we want to show]
Proof:
  1. [Statement]     [Reason: Given/Axiom/Previous theorem]
  2. [Statement]     [Reason: ...]
  ...
  n. [Conclusion]    [Reason: ...]  ∎
```

**Example:** Prove base angles of isosceles triangle are equal.

```
Given: △ABC with AB = AC
Prove: ∠B = ∠C

Proof:
  1. Draw angle bisector AD from A to BC     [Construction]
  2. ∠BAD = ∠CAD                             [Definition of angle bisector]
  3. AB = AC                                  [Given]
  4. AD = AD                                  [Reflexive property]
  5. △ABD ≅ △ACD                             [SAS congruence]
  6. ∠B = ∠C                                  [CPCTC]  ∎
```

### Verification Algorithm

**To check if a proof is valid:**

```python
def verify_proof(proof_steps):
    """
    Verify each step cites proper justification.
    
    Returns: True if valid, False otherwise
    """
    known_facts = set(['given_facts', 'axioms', 'postulates'])
    
    for step in proof_steps:
        reason = step.reason
        if reason in ['Given', 'Axiom', 'Postulate']:
            known_facts.add(step.statement)
        elif reason in known_facts:
            known_facts.add(step.statement)
        else:
            return False  # Invalid step
    
    return proof_steps[-1].statement == 'desired_conclusion'
```

## Examples Progression

### Example 1: Simplest Application

**Given:** Points $A$ and $B$

**Question:** How many lines pass through both?

**Solution:** By Postulate 1, exactly **one** line passes through any two distinct points.

**Verification:** Try to draw two different lines through both points—impossible!

---

### Example 2: Standard Application

**Given:** Line $\ell: y = 2x + 1$ and point $P(3, 4)$ not on $\ell$

**Question:** How many lines through $P$ parallel to $\ell$?

**Solution:**  
By Postulate 5 (Parallel Postulate), exactly **one** line through $P$ is parallel to $\ell$.

**Finding it:** Parallel lines have equal slopes.  
Slope of $\ell = 2$, so parallel line: $y - 4 = 2(x - 3)$, i.e., $y = 2x - 2$.

**Verification:**  
- Passes through $P$: $4 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$ ✓
- Same slope as $\ell$: Both have $m = 2$ ✓
- Therefore parallel ✓

---

### Example 3: Edge Case

**Given:** Point $P$ **on** line $\ell$

**Question:** How many lines through $P$ parallel to $\ell$?

**Answer:** **Zero!**

**Why:** The parallel postulate requires $P$ **not** be on $\ell$. A line cannot be parallel to itself—by definition, parallel lines don't intersect.

**Common Error:** Thinking "a line is parallel to itself" (incorrect definition).

---

### Example 4: Non-Example (Different Geometry)

**Context:** Geometry on a sphere's surface

**Setup:** Great circles (like equators) act as "lines"

**Observation:** Through a point $P$ not on great circle $\ell$:
- **Zero** parallel lines exist!
- All great circles eventually intersect

**Conclusion:** This is **spherical (elliptic) geometry**, not Euclidean. Postulate 5 fails on spheres.

**Significance:** Shows Postulate 5 is truly necessary for Euclidean geometry.

## Common Pitfalls

{% callout_warning() %}
## Mistakes to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Assuming What Needs Proof**

# Distance and Angle Measurement 

## Motivation & Context

### Why Precise Measurement Matters

**Ancient Applications:**
- **Egypt (3000 BCE)**: Re-surveying land after Nile floods
- **Greece (500 BCE)**: Navigation and astronomy
- **Construction**: Building pyramids, temples (precise angles crucial)

**Modern Applications:**
- **Machine Learning**: Distance defines similarity
- **Physics**: Spacetime geometry
- **Computer Graphics**: Rendering 3D scenes
- **Robotics**: Path planning and localization

### The Core Problem

> How do we quantify "how far apart" two objects are?

Intuitive notions break down:
- "Close" vs "far" is subjective
- Different paths give different lengths
- Need mathematical precision

### Historical Breakthrough

**Pythagoras (c. 500 BCE)** discovered the relationship in right triangles that enables distance calculation in coordinates:

$$d^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2$$

This formula underlies *all* distance calculations in ML!

## Intuitive Picture

### Distance

**Physical Analogy:** Measuring tape stretched taut between two points.

**Key Properties:**
- Always positive (or zero if points coincide)
- Symmetric: distance from A to B equals B to A
- Triangle inequality: Direct path is shortest

**Mental Image:**
```
    B
   /|
  / |
 /  | vertical
/   | distance
-----
 horiz
 dist
A
```

The **straight-line distance** is the hypotenuse.

### Angle

**Physical Analogy:** Amount of "turning" between two directions.

**Examples:**
- Clock hands: 12→3 is 90° (quarter turn)
- Compass: North→East is 90°
- Steering wheel: Amount of rotation

**Mental Image:** Angle = opening between two rays.

## Precise Definitions

### Distance (Euclidean Metric)

**Definition 2.1** (Distance in $\mathbb{R}^2$).  
The **distance** between points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ is:

$$d(A, B) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

**Generalization to $\mathbb{R}^n$:**

$$d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i)^2} = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{x}\|_2$$

**Metric Properties:** For all points $A, B, C$:

1. **Positivity**: $d(A,B) \geq 0$, with equality iff $A = B$
2. **Symmetry**: $d(A,B) = d(B,A)$
3. **Triangle Inequality**: $d(A,C) \leq d(A,B) + d(B,C)$

### Angle Measurement

**Definition 2.2** (Angle).  
An **angle** is formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint (vertex).

**Units:**
- **Degrees**: Full circle = 360°
- **Radians**: Full circle = $2\pi$ rad
- **Gradians**: Full circle = 400 grad (rarely used)

**Conversion:**
$$\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \times \frac{\pi}{180}$$

**Definition 2.3** (Angle Classification).

| Type | Measure | Visual |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Acute** | $0° < \theta < 90°$ | Sharp |
| **Right** | $\theta = 90°$ | L-shape |
| **Obtuse** | $90° < \theta < 180°$ | Wide |
| **Straight** | $\theta = 180°$ | Line |
| **Reflex** | $180° < \theta < 360°$ | More than straight |

## Why These Definitions

### Why the Square Root Formula?

The distance formula derives from the **Pythagorean theorem**:

```
     B(x₂,y₂)
        /|
     d / |
      /  | Δy
     /   |
    /____|
  A(x₁,y₁)
     Δx
```

By Pythagoras on the right triangle:
$$d^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2$$

Taking the square root gives the distance formula.

**Why squared terms?** 
- Makes distance always positive
- Satisfies triangle inequality
- Emerges naturally from inner products in linear algebra

### Why Radians as the "Natural" Unit?

**Radians** defined by:
$$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$

where $s$ = arc length, $r$ = radius.

**Advantages:**
1. **Calculus works cleanly**: $\frac{d}{dx}\sin x = \cos x$ (only in radians!)
2. **Taylor series simple**: $\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \cdots$
3. **Arc length formula**: $s = r\theta$ (direct, no conversion)
4. **Natural units**: $\theta = 1$ rad means arc length equals radius

**Degrees are arbitrary:** 360° chosen by Babylonians (base-60 system, divisibility).

## Key Properties

### Properties of Distance

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 2.1** (Distance Invariance).  
Distance is **invariant** under:
- **Translation**: Shifting all points by same vector
- **Rotation**: Rotating entire figure
- **Reflection**: Mirroring across a line

*This is what makes distance a fundamental geometric quantity—it doesn't depend on coordinate system choice.*
{% end %}

**Proof sketch (Translation):**  
If we shift $A \to A'$ and $B \to B'$ by vector $\mathbf{v}$:
$$d(A', B') = \|(B + \mathbf{v}) - (A + \mathbf{v})\| = \|B - A\| = d(A, B)$$

### Properties of Angles

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 2.2** (Angle Addition).  
If ray $\overrightarrow{OB}$ lies between $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OC}$:
$$\angle AOC = \angle AOB + \angle BOC$$
{% end %}

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 2.3** (Vertical Angles).  
When two lines intersect, **vertical angles** are congruent.
{% end %}

```
    \ α /
     \|/
  ----+---- β
     /|\
    / γ \
```

*Proof:* $\alpha + \beta = 180°$ and $\beta + \gamma = 180°$ (linear pairs)  
Therefore $\alpha = \gamma$ (both equal $180° - \beta$). $\square$

## Main Theorems

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 2.4** (Angle Sum in Triangle).  
The sum of interior angles in any triangle is **180°**.
{% end %}

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 2.5** (Exterior Angle Theorem).  
An exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
{% end %}

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 2.6** (Perpendicular Distance).  
The shortest distance from point $P$ to line $\ell$ is the **perpendicular distance**.
{% end %}

*Proof:* Any other path from $P$ to $\ell$ forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, which is longer than the leg. $\square$

## Examples Progression

### Example 1: Simplest

**Problem:** Find distance between $A(0, 0)$ and $B(3, 4)$.

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

**Verification:** This is the famous 3-4-5 right triangle!

---

### Example 2: Standard

**Problem:** Find distance between $A(-2, 3)$ and $B(1, 7)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(1-(-2))^2 + (7-3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$$

**Observation:** Same distance as Example 1—translation doesn't change distance!

---

### Example 3: Higher Dimension

**Problem:** Find distance between $A(1, 2, 3)$ and $B(4, 6, 8)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2 + (8-3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 25} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$$

**Pattern:** Pythagorean theorem extends to any dimension!

---

### Example 4: Edge Case

**Problem:** Distance between $A(2, 5)$ and itself.

**Solution:**
$$d = \sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (5-5)^2} = 0$$

**Interpretation:** Only coincident points have distance 0 (metric axiom).

---

### Example 5: Non-Example (Manhattan Distance)

**Context:** In a city grid, you can't walk diagonally through buildings.

**Manhattan distance:** $d_1(A, B) = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|$

**For** $A(0, 0)$, $B(3, 4)$:
- **Euclidean**: $d_2 = 5$
- **Manhattan**: $d_1 = 7$

**Note:** This is a different **metric**—satisfies metric axioms but uses different formula.

## Common Pitfalls

{% callout_warning() %}
## Mistakes to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Forgetting Square Root**  
❌ $d = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$  
✅ $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

**Pitfall 2: Using Degrees in Calculus**  
❌ $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x°)$ is undefined!  
✅ Always use radians for calculus: $\frac{d}{dx}\sin x = \cos x$

**Pitfall 3: Assuming Perpendicular Without Verification**  
❌ "Lines look perpendicular"  
✅ Check: slopes multiply to $-1$, or angle = 90° via dot product

**Pitfall 4: Sign Confusion with Angles**  
❌ Treating 270° as -90° inconsistently  
✅ Be consistent: counterclockwise positive (standard convention)

**Pitfall 5: Dimension Mismatch**  
❌ Applying 2D formula to 3D points  
✅ Ensure formula matches dimension: $d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}$

# The Pythagorean Theorem 

## Motivation & Context

### Historical Significance

The Pythagorean theorem is arguably the most important result in elementary mathematics:

**Ancient Knowledge:**
- **Babylonians** (c. 1800 BCE): Knew Pythagorean triples
- **Pythagoras** (c. 500 BCE): First rigorous proof
- **Euclid** (*Elements*, Book I, Prop. 47): Geometric proof
- **China** (*Zhou Bi Suan Jing*, c. 300 BCE): Independent discovery

**Over 370 Different Proofs!**
- Geometric rearrangements
- Algebraic derivations
- Calculus-based approaches
- Even one by U.S. President James Garfield!

### Why It Matters

**Foundation of:**
- Distance calculations in coordinates
- Trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent)
- Euclidean norm in linear algebra
- Spacetime metric in relativity

**ML Applications:**
- Every distance calculation uses this theorem
- Regularization: $\|\theta\|_2^2 = \sum \theta_i^2$
- Gradient magnitude: $\|\nabla f\| = \sqrt{\sum (\partial f/\partial x_i)^2}$
- Neural network initialization: Xavier scales by $\sqrt{n}$

## Intuitive Picture

### The Setup

Draw a right triangle with:
- **Legs**: sides $a$ and $b$ (forming the right angle)
- **Hypotenuse**: side $c$ (opposite the right angle, longest side)

### Visual Proof Intuition

Build squares on each side:

<img src="/mathematics/euclidean_geometry_enhanced_files/visualizations/pythagorean_visual_proof.svg" alt="Pythagorean Visual Proof" style="max-width: 80%">

**Key Insight:** The area of the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of areas on the two legs:

$$\text{Area}(c^2) = \text{Area}(a^2) + \text{Area}(b^2)$$

This isn't just symbolic—you can literally cut and rearrange the smaller squares to fill the larger one!

## Precise Definition

{% callout_tip() %}
**Theorem 3.1** (Pythagorean Theorem).  
In a right triangle with legs of lengths $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse of length $c$:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
{% end %}

{% callout_tip() %}
**Converse (Theorem 3.2).**  
If three sides of a triangle satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, then the triangle is a right triangle with hypotenuse $c$.
{% end %}

## Why These Definitions

### Why Squares of Sides?

**Geometric Reason:** Squares are natural area measurements in Euclidean geometry.

**Algebraic Reason:** Powers of 2 appear naturally in:
- Distance formulas: $d^2 = \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = E[(X - \mu)^2]$
- Least squares: minimize $\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$

**Physical Reason:** Energy scales with square of velocity: $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

### Why Only Right Triangles?

The perpendicularity (90° angle) is essential. For other angles:

**Law of Cosines** (generalizes Pythagorean theorem):
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$$

- When $C = 90°$: $\cos 90° = 0$, so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ (Pythagorean!)
- When $C < 90°$ (acute): $\cos C > 0$, so $c^2 < a^2 + b^2$
- When $C > 90°$ (obtuse): $\cos C < 0$, so $c^2 > a^2 + b^2$

## Key Properties

### Pythagorean Triples

{% callout_note() %}
**Definition:** Integer solutions to $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
{% end %}

**Common Examples:**
| $a$ | $b$ | $c$ | Verification |
|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| 3   | 4   | 5   | $9 + 16 = 25$ ✓ |
| 5   | 12  | 13  | $25 + 144 = 169$ ✓ |
| 8   | 15  | 17  | $64 + 225 = 289$ ✓ |
| 7   | 24  | 25  | $49 + 576 = 625$ ✓ |

**Property:** If $(a, b, c)$ is a triple, so is $(ka, kb, kc)$ for any $k > 0$.

### Connection to Distance Formula

The distance between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ follows from applying Pythagorean theorem:

```
     (x₂,y₂)
        /|
     d / |
      /  | |y₂-y₁|
     /   |
    /____|
 (x₁,y₁)
   |x₂-x₁|
```

By Pythagoras:
$$d^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$$

Therefore:
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

This generalizes to $n$ dimensions!

## Main Theorems (Multiple Proofs)

### Proof 1: Rearrangement (Most Intuitive)

**Setup:** Square of side $(a + b)$ containing four copies of the triangle.

**Area calculation (two methods):**

**Method 1:** Outer square  
$$A_{\text{outer}} = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

**Method 2:** Four triangles + inner square  
$$A_{\text{triangles + inner}} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}ab + c^2 = 2ab + c^2$$

**Equating:**
$$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2$$
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad \square$$

### Proof 2: Similarity (Geometric)

**Setup:** Drop altitude from right angle to hypotenuse, dividing it into segments $p$ and $q$ where $p + q = c$.

**Key observation:** Creates three similar triangles:
1. Original: legs $a, b$, hypotenuse $c$
2. Left sub-triangle  
3. Right sub-triangle

**From similarity:**
$$\frac{a}{c} = \frac{p}{a} \Rightarrow a^2 = cp$$
$$\frac{b}{c} = \frac{q}{b} \Rightarrow b^2 = cq$$

**Adding:**
$$a^2 + b^2 = cp + cq = c(p + q) = c \cdot c = c^2 \quad \square$$

### Proof 3: Coordinate Geometry

**Setup:** Place right angle at origin, legs along axes.

**Coordinates:** $O = (0, 0)$, $A = (a, 0)$, $B = (0, b)$

**Distance from $A$ to $B$:**
$$c = \sqrt{(0 - a)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

**Squaring:**
$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \quad \square$$

## Computational Methods

### Finding the Third Side

```python
import math

def pythagorean_solve(a=None, b=None, c=None):
    """
    Solve for missing side of right triangle.
    
    Args:
        a, b: legs (one may be None)
        c: hypotenuse (may be None)
    
    Returns:
        float: the missing side
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: if not exactly one side is unknown
    
    Examples:
        >>> pythagorean_solve(b=4, c=5)  # find a
        3.0
        >>> pythagorean_solve(a=3, b=4)  # find c
        5.0
    """
    unknown_count = sum(x is None for x in [a, b, c])
    if unknown_count != 1:
        raise ValueError("Exactly one side must be unknown")
    
    if a is None:
        if c <= b:
            raise ValueError("Hypotenuse must be longest side")
        return math.sqrt(c**2 - b**2)
    elif b is None:
        if c <= a:
            raise ValueError("Hypotenuse must be longest side")
        return math.sqrt(c**2 - a**2)
    else:  # c is None
        return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

# Example usage
print(f"3-4-?: {pythagorean_solve(a=3, b=4)}")  # 5.0
print(f"5-?-13: {pythagorean_solve(a=5, c=13)}")  # 12.0
```

### Generating Pythagorean Triples

**Euclid's Formula:** For integers $m > n > 0$:

$$a = m^2 - n^2, \quad b = 2mn, \quad c = m^2 + n^2$$

generates all **primitive** triples (where $\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$).

```python
def generate_pythagorean_triples(max_c, primitive_only=True):
    """
    Generate Pythagorean triples up to max hypotenuse.
    
    Args:
        max_c: maximum hypotenuse value
        primitive_only: if True, only primitive triples
    
    Returns:
        list of (a, b, c) tuples
    
    Examples:
        >>> triples = generate_pythagorean_triples(30)
        >>> (3, 4, 5) in triples
        True
    """
    triples = []
    m = 2
    while m**2 + 1 <= max_c:
        for n in range(1, m):
            a = m**2 - n**2
            b = 2 * m * n
            c = m**2 + n**2
            
            if c > max_c:
                break
            
            # Ensure a < b for consistency
            if a > b:
                a, b = b, a
            
            if primitive_only:
                triples.append((a, b, c))
            else:
                # Add multiples
                k = 1
                while k * c <= max_c:
                    triples.append((k*a, k*b, k*c))
                    k += 1
        m += 1
    
    return sorted(set(triples), key=lambda t: t[2])

# Generate triples with c ≤ 30
for a, b, c in generate_pythagorean_triples(30):
    print(f"({a}, {b}, {c}): {a}² + {b}² = {a**2} + {b**2} = {a**2+b**2} = {c}² = {c**2}")
```

## Examples Progression

### Example 1: Simplest (3-4-5)

**Given:** Right triangle with legs 3 and 4

**Find:** Hypotenuse

**Solution:**
$$c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

**Verification:** $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$ ✓

---

### Example 2: Standard (Missing Leg)

**Given:** Right triangle with leg 5 and hypotenuse 13

**Find:** Other leg

**Solution:**
$$b = \sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{169 - 25} = \sqrt{144} = 12$$

**Verification:** $5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2$ ✓

**Note:** This is the 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple!

---

### Example 3: 3D Distance

**Given:** Points $A(1, 2, 3)$ and $B(4, 6, 8)$ in space

**Find:** Distance

**Method:** Apply Pythagorean theorem twice:

**Step 1:** Distance in $xy$-plane:
$$d_{xy} = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$$

**Step 2:** Add $z$-component:
$$d = \sqrt{d_{xy}^2 + (8-3)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$$

**Direct formula:**
$$d = \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2 + (8-3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16 + 25} = 5\sqrt{2}$$

---

### Example 4: Edge Case (Degenerate)

**Given:** "Triangle" with sides 0, 4, 4

**Check:** $0^2 + 4^2 = 0 + 16 = 16 = 4^2$ ✓

**Interpretation:** Degenerate case—the two legs are collinear (form a straight line). The "triangle" is actually a line segment of length 4.

---

### Example 5: Non-Example (Obtuse Triangle)

**Given:** Triangle with sides 3, 4, 6

**Check:** $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$ but $6^2 = 36$

**Result:** $25 \neq 36$, so NOT a right triangle.

**Analysis:** $25 < 36 \Rightarrow$ **obtuse** triangle (angle opposite longest side > 90°)

**Law of Cosines:** $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$
$$36 = 9 + 16 - 2(3)(4)\cos C$$
$$36 = 25 - 24\cos C$$
$$\cos C = -\frac{11}{24} < 0$$

Since $\cos C < 0$, we have $C > 90°$ (obtuse).

## Common Pitfalls

{% callout_warning() %}
## Mistakes to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Forgetting Which Side is Hypotenuse**  
❌ $5^2 + 13^2 = c^2$ (treating 13 as a leg)  
✅ Hypotenuse is **always** opposite the right angle and is the **longest** side

**Pitfall 2: Using for Non-Right Triangles**  
❌ Applying $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ to any triangle  
✅ For non-right triangles, use Law of Cosines: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$

**Pitfall 3: Arithmetic Errors**  
❌ $(c-a)^2 = c^2 - a^2$ (WRONG!)  
✅ $c^2 - a^2 \neq (c-a)^2$; must use $b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}$

**Pitfall 4: Negative "Solutions"**  
❌ Accepting $c = -5$ as a solution  
✅ Side lengths must be **positive**: $c = 5$

**Pitfall 5: Confusing $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ with $a + b = c$**  
❌ $3 + 4 = 7 \neq 5$, so theorem wrong?  
✅ It's $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$ ✓

**Pitfall 6: Rounding Too Early**  
❌ $\sqrt{50} \approx 7$, so use 7  
✅ Keep exact: $\sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.071$

### This Concept Enables

**Immediate Applications:**
- **Distance Formula**: Direct application
- **Trigonometry**: Foundation for trig functions
- **Circles**: Computing chord lengths, tangent properties

**Advanced Topics:**
- **Euclidean Norm** (Linear Algebra): $\|\mathbf{x}\| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}$

```

**Gradient Magnitude:**
$$\|\nabla f\| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2 + \cdots}$$

<details>
<summary>Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

$$d = \sqrt{(5-(-3))^2 + (8-2)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10$$

### Problem 2: Pythagorean Application

**Given:** A 20-foot ladder leans against a wall. The base is 12 feet from the wall.

**Find:** Height the ladder reaches on the wall

<details>
<summary>Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

Let $h$ = height on wall. We have a right triangle with:
- Hypotenuse: $c = 20$ ft (ladder)
- Base: $a = 12$ ft
- Height: $b = h$ ft (unknown)

By Pythagorean theorem:
$$12^2 + h^2 = 20^2$$
$$144 + h^2 = 400$$
$$h^2 = 256$$
$$h = 16 \text{ ft}$$

**Answer:** 16 feet high

**Verification:** $12^2 + 16^2 = 144 + 256 = 400 = 20^2$ ✓

**Note:** This is a multiple of the 3-4-5 triple: $(12, 16, 20) = 4 \times (3, 4, 5)$

### Problem 3: Congruence Proof

**Given:** $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ with:
- $AB = 8$, $BC = 10$, $CA = 12$  
- $DE = 8$, $EF = 10$, $FD = 12$

**Prove:** The triangles are congruent

<details>
<summary>Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

### Problem 4: Non-Right Triangle

**Given:** Triangle with sides 7, 8, 12

**Question:** Is this a right triangle? If not, is it acute or obtuse?

<details>
<summary>Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

**Check:** Does $7^2 + 8^2 = 12^2$?

$$49 + 64 = 113 \neq 144$$

So it's **not** a right triangle.

**Determine acute vs obtuse:**

$7^2 + 8^2 = 113 < 144 = 12^2$

Since $a^2 + b^2 < c^2$, the triangle is **obtuse** (angle opposite longest side > 90°).

**Verification with Law of Cosines:**
$$\cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = \frac{49 + 64 - 144}{2(7)(8)} = \frac{-31}{112} < 0$$

Since $\cos C < 0$, we have $90° < C < 180°$ (obtuse). ✓

**Answer:** Obtuse triangle
</details>

### Problem 5: 3D Distance

**Given:** Points $P(2, -1, 3)$ and $Q(5, 3, -1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$

**Find:** Distance $PQ$

<details>
<summary>Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

Apply 3D distance formula:
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}$$

$$d = \sqrt{(5-2)^2 + (3-(-1))^2 + ((-1)-3)^2}$$
$$= \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + (-4)^2}$$
$$= \sqrt{9 + 16 + 16}$$
$$= \sqrt{41}$$

**Answer:** $\sqrt{41} \approx 6.40$ units

**Note:** This is NOT a Pythagorean triple (41 is not a perfect square).
